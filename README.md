### 📝 Personal Information

Update your contact information in `src/utils/me.ts`:
- Name
- Homepage URL
- LinkedIn username
- GitHub username

The following contact fields are also in `src/utils/me.ts` but are Base64 encoded to obfuscate them in the GitHub repo.
See the comments in `me.ts` for instructions on how to encode your information in Base64 with a simple command.
- Email
- Phone
- Address (for privacy policy)

Also update your information in the following other files:
- `astro.config.mjs` and `robots.txt`: Replace `https://max-example.de/` with your site's URL
- `src/i18n/en.json` and `src/i18n/de.json`: Contains all text content in English and German
- Replace images in `src/assets/` with your own:
  - `logo.png` and `logo_white.png` - Your brand logos
  - `profile.png` - Your profile photo
  - `favicon.png` - The favicon for your website
  - Other images for projects and sections

### 🎭 Theme Colors

Modify the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.mjs` to change the color scheme:

```js
// Example customization
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#3B82F6',       // Change to your primary brand color
      secondary: '#1F2937',     // Change to your secondary color
      accent: '#10B981',        // Change to your accent color
      // ... other color customizations
    }
  }
}
```

### 🖼️ Adding Projects

Add your projects by editing the project section in the language files:

```json
"projects": {
  "title": "Selected Projects",
  "subtitle": "A selection of my best work",
  "projectName": {
    "shortDescription": "Brief description of the project",
    "challenge": "The problem this project solved",
    "approach": "How you approached the solution",
    "result": "The outcome and impact of the project"
  }
}
```

### 🌐 Adding Another Language

1. Create a new language file in `src/i18n/` (e.g., `fr.json` for French)
2. Copy the structure from `en.json` and translate all values
3. Update the language switcher component to include the new language
